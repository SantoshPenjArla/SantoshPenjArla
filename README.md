## Namaste! Santosh here. About me in this readme below:

```
- I am a passonate problem solver with a pool of ideas in backlog to transform into usable piece of product. 
- In adaptive learning mode to learn from surrounding environments
- Trying to understand others in their view, so always tries to exchange the private-public key pair with them
- Expecting to give out my best in distributed mode, so that I achieve some good performance 
```

*Sounded robotic?*
May be I am spending time mostly on them more now-a-days ðŸ˜±. Don't worry, I can context switch to normal mode also (but not here) ;)
